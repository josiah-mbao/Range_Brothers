This is my clothing store web app. Welcome to Range Brothers.
This is what I consider my first "real" project. I am doing this
completely on my own accord and I predict it will be a helluva
journey making this. I don't imagine this journey has a destination,
 but rather the journey itself is the destination. Let's get started!


** Day 2 **
I have done a draft of what the homepage will look like. I like how
it looks but for sure, there's always room for improvement. Now, I am
setting up Django and making models for the website. I have elected to
use Django's in-built User model. First 2 days and I am happy with the
progress made so far:)
